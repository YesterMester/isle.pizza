# [isle.pizza](https://isle.pizza) frontend

This is a custom frontend for the Emscripten port of [isle-portable](https://github.com/isledecomp/isle-portable). To use this, build the Emscripten version of the game and couple `isle.js` as well as `isle.wasm` with the files in this repository, and open `index.html`.

[A Docker image that bundles the runtime with this frontend is also available](https://github.com/isledecomp/isle-portable/wiki/Installation#web-port-emscripten).
